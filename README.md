Super Mario Gun is a highly advanced virtual experience unlike any other. Evade obstacles, vanquish evil enemies. There is no limit, apart from the countless limitations.

# How to play
* Load up Super Mario Gun at jabenc.github.io/mario-game. You need a keyboard and mouse in order to play. 
* You could open it with a touchscreen, but there's no way to control anything.
* Your browser needs to support OpenGL. I can't remember if it's 2 or 3. But nobody's going to read this so who cares

# Credits
This game is made in the Godot Engine. Thank you for providing the functions that were easy enough for me to use. Also special thanks to those countless YouTube tutorials that I was
**heavily** inspired by.
